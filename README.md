# hello-world
My first Git Repo for storing ideas, little fiddly bits, and more.
I didn't read the Markdown Elements tutorial and i'm sorry Github overlords

Just testing out branching on my readme before re-merging

Hi my name is Max, i'm 26 and on a self-teaching journey for learning how to program/code.
I currently work in Talent Acquisition / Recruitment as a technical recruiter where I have been hiring software engineers for the past ~5 years now
Originally I played with Udemy courses on Java (my original hiring vertical) but tracking the market over the last 5 years i've decided to look more into progressive web applications & frontend.

My employer (a software engineering consultancy) has given me the platform and resources to take my learning to the next stage and i'm excited to get started here before attending a more in depth boot-camp later on in 2022.
